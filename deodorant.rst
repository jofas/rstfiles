Deodorant Recipe
================

This is a super simple recipe for a deodorant cream.
Only contains natural ingredients.
Vegan and technically eatable, though probably not as tasty as it
is fragrant.

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 parts coconut oil (preferrably odorless)
* 1 part baking soda
* 1 part starch
* A few drops of your preferred perfume oils

Preparation
-----------

1. Lightly heat the coconut oil till it becomes liquid
2. Take coconut oil off the heat, mix in baking soda and starch
3. Let it cool for five minutes
4. Add a few drops of your preferred perfume oils (mine are lemon, 
   sage and tea tree). If the coconut oil was not odorless, you 
   might need to add a few more drops
5. Use after the deodorant has hardened again (you may put it in
   the fridge to accelerate the cooling process)
