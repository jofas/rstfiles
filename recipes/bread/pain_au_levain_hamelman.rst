Preparation
-----------

1. **Levain:** 12 to 16 hours before making final dough.

2. **Autolyse:** Mix the flour and water for the final dough until
   water is incorporated.
   20 to 60 minutes before making final dough.

3. **Mixing:** Sprinkle salt over autolyse dough and add the levain.
   Mix till the dough has a medium consistency.

4. **Bulk fermentation:** 3 hours, 2 folds after 60 and 120 minutes.

5. **Shaping:** Round or oval. For baguettes rather use 65% hydration
   or make sure the dough is stronger, as otherwise it is tough to
   handle.

6. **Final fermentation:** 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours or up to 48 hours
   in the fridge.

7. **Baking:** 250 deg. Celcius for about 35 minutes, with steam.
