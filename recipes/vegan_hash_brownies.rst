=============================  ===========


Preparation
-----------

1. **Deboxylisation:** Heat up the oven to 125 deg. Celcius and roast
   your hash or weed for 30 minutes.

2. **Cannabis oil:** put the oil in a pan on medium-low heat and
   slowly add in your ground up hash or weed. Let the pan stand on
   medium-low heat (the oil should stay just below its smoke point)
   for 30 minutes or more. Turn off the heat and let oil cool down.
   If you don't want the residue of the powdered hash/grounded weed
   in your oil, strain it through a coffee filter (this may take some
   time).

3. **Mixing:** Put the flour, sugar cocoa powder, baking powder and
   salt into your mixing bowl. Pour in the water, cannabis oil and
   the vanilla extract. Mix until well blended.

4. **Shaping:** Put the dough into a greased baking dish (9x13 inches
   or 27x36 cm).

5. **Baking:** Put the baking dish into the oven, preheated to
   170 deg. Celcius. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
